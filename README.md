Project Story

## Overview

This project is being done as a School Project. I have always loved Choose Your Adventure stories, so I am attempting to create a platform that can both assemble CYOA stories, as well as read them.

Welcome to "Project Story!" This project is split between two parts. The first part is the Story Compiler, which will take story files and put them together into a cohesive format. The second part is the Story Runner, which takes this file and runs it.
